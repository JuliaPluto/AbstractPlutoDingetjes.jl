# AbstractPlutoDingetjes.jl

An abstract package to be implemented by packages/people who create widgets (or other [*dingetjes*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dingetjes#Dutch)) for Pluto. If you are just happy using Pluto to make cool stuff, you probably don't want to use this package directly. This package is not *necessary* to create widgets in Pluto, but it can add more advanced functionality to your widgets.
